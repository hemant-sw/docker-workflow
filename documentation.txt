TO create image of any repo or project.
1- first we have to create a docker file 
   - Docker file should be name as Dockerfile
   - In docker file we write all step required to run in order to run our app perfectly 
   - Docker file should be hidden when we docekerizing our app for that we make docker ignore file
     (.dockerignore) in this we write all files that should be hidden.

2- To make image of our current project we use command
       ( docker build -t image-name .)
    - Above command will create iamge of our project 
    - To view all images that are present either you can see from docker desktop app or by running
     a command (docker image ls)
     - this command will list all the images present inside our system

3 - After creating image of your project next you need to run it to do that you need to run a command
   ( docker run -d --name my-app my-image)
    - But with this command you will not able to run it on your browser, to run in browser you need to
      specify port for that use command 
      ( docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name my-app my-image)
    - By use this command you can run it on your browser (localhost:3000)
    
4 - We almost all done but problem is that when we make any changers in our app it will not to goingt s
    show in our browser that is because we have created iamge of our project before we make that changes 
    (image created on 11:00 PM but we make changes after 11:00 PM) to view those changes again we have to
    to delete the running container to delete container use this command (docker rm my-app-name -f )

  - After that you also need to delete iamge - to delete image use this command (docker image rm my-image)

  - And you again need repeat the whole step like create image run that in browsser after that you will se
    your changer and that is very hectic process.

  - To over come this issue for that we use Volumes (bind mounts).

  - To save changes locally we use another command for that we need to delete the running container and use this command
    ( docker run -v ${pwd}/src:/app/src -d -p 3000:3000 --name my-app my-image) use this command in powershell

  - But in windows to view changes on browser use this
    (docker run -e WATCHPACK_POLLING=true -v ${pwd}/src:/app/src -d -p 3000:3000 --name my-app my-image ) 

5 - But this data should be in read-only format beacuse after development we don't want any changes in our project for that run
    this command
    ( docker run -e WATCHPACK_POLLING=true -v ${pwd}/src:/app/src:ro -d -p 3000:3000 --name my-app my-image)

6 - To make our command cleaner we use separate enviromental variable file
  - Create a fil (.env and wite all your en variable in  it)

7 - To simplify our CLI more we create one more file (yaml file) and we name as [ docker-compose.yaml ] and in this file we but all necessary
    like -
          version: "3"
          services:
           react-app:
              build:
              context: .
              dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
          ports:
              - "3000:3000"
          volumes:
              - ./src:/app/src
          environment:
              - REACT_APP_NAME=hemant
              - CHINESE_FOOD= rtuoh
              - WATCHPACK_POLLING=TRUE

  - After creating this yaml file we don't need to use any leanthy run commands.
  - To run our all services and container we just use this command
     { docker-compose up -d}
  - But with this command we just run our container but when we make changes in our dockerfile it will not be synced in our images.
  - To overcome this issue we have to build a brand new image every time when we up the container for this use this command.
      { docker-compose up -d --build } 
  - To bring all container down we have to use this comamnd 
      { docker-compose down}
